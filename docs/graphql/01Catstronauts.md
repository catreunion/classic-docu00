# Catstronauts

A learning platform for adventurous cats who want to explore the universe! üò∫ üöÄ Created by [Apollo Odyssey tutorials](https://www.apollographql.com/tutorials/), a series of amazing and helpful tutorials about GraphQL. Thank you the creation team!! üôèüèª

## What data do we need?

1. Think of our app's data as a collection of objects (**nodes**) and relationships (**edges**) between objects.

2. Think of our entire data model as a graph of nodes and edges.

3. Define this graph structure using a schema.

## Schema Definition Language (SDL)

At its heart, a schema is a collection of **object types** that **contain fields**. A schema is like a contract between the server and the client. It defines what a GraphQL API can and can't do, and how clients can request or change data.

The **fields** of Query object type are the **entry points** into the schema. They are the **top-level** fields that clients can query for.

We structure our schema to provide that data as intuitively as possible.

Open the repository in your favorite IDE.

```js title="server/src/schema.js"
// declare a typeDefs (short for "type definitions") constant
// wrap GraphQL strings with the gql tag (template literal)
// convert/parse GraphQL strings into the format that Apollo libraries expect
// use backticks (`), don't confused with single quotes (')
// declare an object type called SpaceCat in PascalCase with curly brackets
// declare a field called name in camelCase with a colon and without commas
// if a field should never be null (non-nullable), add an exclamation mark after its type
// declare a field called missions which is an array of missions indicated by square brackets
// descriptions are strings wrapped with double quotes

const typeDefs = gql`
  type SpaceCat {
    id: ID!
    name: String!
    age: Int
    missions: [Mission]
  }

  type Mission {
    id: ID!
    codename: String!
    to: String!
    scheduled: Boolean!
    crewMembers: [SpaceCat]!
  }

  type Query {
    spaceCats: [SpaceCat]
  }
`
```

## Sending a query in Apollo Sandbox

Sandbox is a special mode of Apollo Studio for testing the **local server** before deploying the graph to Schema Registry.

```graphql title="running a client query in Apollo Sandbox"
<!-- start up the local Apollo server -->
<!-- navigate to http://localhost:4000 in Firefox or Chrome -->

query getTracksForHome {
  tracksForHome {
    id
    title
    thumbnail
    length
    modulesCount
    author {
      id
      name
      photo
    }
  }
}
```

## Journey of a query operation

1. Our web app (GraphQL client) sends a GraphQL query operation, formatted as a string in HTTP POST or GET request, to the remote GraphQL server.

2. The server **parses** and **transforms** the string into a tree-structured document called an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST).

3. The server **validates** the query operation against the **types** and **fields** defined in our **schema**.

4. For **each field** in the query, the server invokes that field's **resolver function** to populate data from the correct source.

5. As all of the query's fields are resolved, the **data is assembled / stitched into a nicely ordered JSON object** with the **exact same shape as the query**.

6. The server assigns the JSON object to the **data key** of the HTTP response body, and send it back to our web app.

7. The GraphQL client receives the response and then passes the data to the right components for rendering.

## Data fetching

### Where is our data stored?

[the Catstronauts REST API](https://odyssey-lift-off-rest-api.herokuapp.com/)

```text title="6 endpoints"
GET   /tracks
GET   /track/:id
PATCH /track/:id
GET   /track/:id/modules
GET   /author/:id
GET   /module/:id
```

### How is our data structured?

A GraphQL query operation is often composed of a mix of different fields and types, coming from different endpoints, with different cache policies.

```graphql title="a client query operation"
<!-- start up the local Apollo server -->
<!-- navigate to http://localhost:4000 in Firefox or Chrome -->

query getTracksForHome {
  tracksForHome {
    id
    title
    thumbnail
    length
    modulesCount
    author {
      id
      name
      photo
    }
  }
}
```

Is that structure different from our client app's needs and schema?

```js title="retrieving all the tracks"
fetch("apiUrl/tracks").then(function (response) {
  // do something with our tracks JSON
})
```

```json title="a test result"
[
  {
    "id": "c_0",
    "thumbnail": "https://res.cloudinary.com/dety84pbu/image/upload/v1598465568/nebula_cat_djkt9r.jpg",
    "topic": "Cat-stronomy",
    "authorId": "cat-1",
    "title": "Cat-stronomy, an introduction",
    "description": "Curious to learn what Cat-stronomy is all about? Explore the planetary and celestial alignments and how they have affected our space missions.",
    "numberOfViews": 0,
    "createdAt": "2018-09-10T07:13:53.020Z",
    "length": 2377,
    "modulesCount": 10,
    "modules": ["l_0", "l_1", "l_2", "l_3", "l_4", "l_5", "l_6", "l_7", "l_8", "l_9"]
  },
  {...},
]
```

`author` is missing.

```js title="retrieving a author"
fetch(`apiUrl/author/${authorId}`).then(function (response) {
  // this is the author of our track
})
```

### The N+1 problem

"1" : the call to fetch the top-level tracks field.

"N" : the number of subsequent calls to fetch the author subfield for each track.

Making N calls to the exact same endpoint to fetch the exact same data is very inefficient, especially if N is a large number.

```graphql title="the N+1 problem"
{
  tracks {
    # 1
    title
    author {
      # N calls for N tracks
      name
    }
  }
}
```

### The `RESTDataSource` class

How to retrieve and transform the data that we need to match the fields in our schema?

cache : avoid unnecessary calls to our REST API.

Resource caching prevents unneccessary API calls for data that doesn't change frequently.

```js title="server/src/datasources/spacecats-api.js"
const { RESTDataSource } = require("apollo-datasource-rest")

// declare a class called `SpaceCatsAPI` that extends the RESTDataSource class
class SpaceCatsAPI extends RESTDataSource {
  // constructor method
  constructor() {
    super()
    this.baseURL = "https://fake-spacecats-rest-api.cat/"
  }

  // define the following helper methods that make API calls efficient

  getSpaceCats() {
    // perform a GET request to the `spacecats` endpoint
    return this.get("spacecats")
  }

  // take `catId` as an argument
  getMissions(catId) {
    // string interpolation
    return this.get(`spacecats/${catId}/missions`)
  }
}

module.exports = SpaceCatsAPI
```

## 4 parameters of a resolver

`parent` : Contain the **data** returned from the **previous** function in a **resolver chain**.

`args` : Contain all the **arguments** provided to the field for querying a specific item.

`context` : Used to access the methods defined in `RESTDataSource`, or to access authentication info

`info` : Contain informational properties about the operation's execution state, including the field name, the path to the field from the root, and more

## Implementing Resolvers

- Data resolvers in a GraphQL server can work with any number of data sources.

- Their **keys** correspond to the **object types** in schema.

- A resolver is a function. It has the **same name as the field** that it populates the data for.

- Resolver functions filter the data properties to match only what the query asks for.

The `Query` type contains the **entry points** to our schema. There are two other possible entry points: **Mutation** and **Subscription**

Apollo Sandbox Explorer : A special mode of Apollo Studio that lets you interactively build and test queries against the local GraphQL server.

```js
const resolvers = {
  Query: {
    spaceCats: (_, __, { dataSources }) => {
      return dataSources.spaceCatsAPI.getSpaceCats()
    }
  }
  SpaceCat: {
    missions: ({catId}, _, {dataSources}) => {
      return dataSources.spaceCatsAPI.getMissions(catId)
    }
  }
}
```

## Schema, resolvers & data sources

```js
const server = new ApolloServer({
  typeDefs,
  resolvers,
  dataSources: () => {
    return {
      spaceCatsAPI: new SpaceCatsAPI()
    }
  }
})
```

## Testing with Apollo Explorer

```text title='Lift-off I'
query GetTracks {
  tracksForHome {
    id
    title
    thumbnail
    length
    modulesCount
    author {
      id
      name
      photo
    }
  }
}
```

```
const lastTrackEntry = {
  //paste the last track entry here
}
```

```js title='server/src/schema.js'
const typeDefs = gql`
  type Query {
    tracksForHome: [Track!]!
    tracksForHomeFetch: [Track!]!
  }

  # ...
`
```

```js title='server/src/resolvers.js'
const resolvers = {
  Query: {
    tracksForHome: () => {
      // ...
    }
    tracksForHomeFetch: async () => {
      const baseUrl = "https://odyssey-lift-off-rest-api.herokuapp.com";
      const res = await fetch(`${baseUrl}/tracks`);
      return res.json();
    },
  },
  Track: {
    // using fetch instead of dataSources
    author: async ({ authorId }, _, { dataSources }) => {
      const baseUrl = "https://odyssey-lift-off-rest-api.herokuapp.com";
      const res = await fetch(`${baseUrl}/author/${authorId}`);
      return res.json();

      // return dataSources.trackAPI.getAuthor(authorId);
    },
  },
}
```
