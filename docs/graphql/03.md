# mongoose

execute GraphQL queries on our server with Apollo Sandbox

mongoose [Mongoose v6.8.2: Getting Started](https://mongoosejs.com/docs/)

SPONSOR #native_company# — #native_desc#

First be sure you have MongoDB and Node.js installed.

```bash
npm install mongoose --save
```

Now say we like fuzzy kittens and want to record every kitten we ever meet in MongoDB. The first thing we need to do is include mongoose in our project and open a connection to the test database on our locally running instance of MongoDB.

// getting-started.js

```js
const mongoose = require("mongoose")

main().catch((err) => console.log(err))

async function main() {
  await mongoose.connect("mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/test")

  // use `await mongoose.connect('mongodb://user:password@127.0.0.1:27017/test');` if your database has auth enabled
}
```

For brevity, let's assume that all following code is within the main() function.

With Mongoose, everything is derived from a Schema. Let's get a reference to it and define our kittens.

```js
const kittySchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  name: String
})
```

So far so good. We've got a schema with one property, name, which will be a String. The next step is compiling our schema into a Model.

```js
const Kitten = mongoose.model("Kitten", kittySchema)
```

A model is a class with which we construct documents. In this case, each document will be a kitten with properties and behaviors as declared in our schema. Let's create a kitten document representing the little guy we just met on the sidewalk outside:

```js
const silence = new Kitten({ name: "Silence" })
console.log(silence.name) // 'Silence'
```

Kittens can meow, so let's take a look at how to add "speak" functionality to our documents:

```js
// NOTE: methods must be added to the schema before compiling it with mongoose.model()
kittySchema.methods.speak = function speak() {
  const greeting = this.name ? "Meow name is " + this.name : "I don't have a name"
  console.log(greeting)
}

const Kitten = mongoose.model("Kitten", kittySchema)
```

Functions added to the methods property of a schema get compiled into the Model prototype and exposed on each document instance:

```js
const fluffy = new Kitten({ name: "fluffy" })
fluffy.speak() // "Meow name is fluffy"
```

We have talking kittens! But we still haven't saved anything to MongoDB. Each document can be saved to the database by calling its save method. The first argument to the callback will be an error if any occurred.

```js
await fluffy.save()
fluffy.speak()
```

Say time goes by and we want to display all the kittens we've seen. We can access all of the kitten documents through our Kitten model.

```js
const kittens = await Kitten.find()
console.log(kittens)
```

We just logged all of the kittens in our db to the console. If we want to filter our kittens by name, Mongoose supports MongoDBs rich querying syntax.

```js
await Kitten.find({ name: /^fluff/ })
```

This performs a search for all documents with a name property that begins with "fluff" and returns the result as an array of kittens to the callback.

Congratulations
That's the end of our quick start. We created a schema, added a custom document method, saved and queried kittens in MongoDB using Mongoose. Head over to the guide, or API docs for more.

A query language for your API
GraphQL is a query language for APIs and a runtime for fulfilling those queries with your existing data. GraphQL provides a complete and understandable description of the data in your API, gives clients the power to ask for exactly what they need and nothing more, makes it easier to evolve APIs over time, and enables powerful developer tools.

Ask for what you need, get exactly that

Send a GraphQL query to your API and get exactly what you need, nothing more and nothing less. GraphQL queries always return predictable results. Apps using GraphQL are fast and stable because they control the data they get, not the server.

```
{
  hero {
    name
    height
    mas
  }
}
{
  "hero": {
      "name": "Luke Skywalker",
      "height": 1.72
  }
}
```

Get many resources in a single request
GraphQL queries access not just the properties of one resource but also smoothly follow references between them. While typical REST APIs require loading from multiple URLs, GraphQL APIs get all the data your app needs in a single request. Apps using GraphQL can be quick even on slow mobile network connections.

```
{
    hero {
    name
    friends {
        name
        }
    }
}
{
    "hero": {
      "name": "Luke Skywalker",
      "friends": [
        { "name": "Obi-Wan Kenobi" },
        { "name": "R2-D2" },
        { "name": "Han Solo" },
        { "name": "Leia Organa" }
      ]
    }
}
```

Describe what’s possible with a type system
GraphQL APIs are organized in terms of types and fields, not endpoints. Access the full capabilities of your data from a single endpoint. GraphQL uses types to ensure Apps only ask for what’s possible and provide clear and helpful errors. Apps can use types to avoid writing manual parsing code.

```
{
  hero {
    name
    friends {
      name
      homeWorld {
        name
        climate
      }
      species {
        name
        lifespan
        origin {
          name
        }
      }
    }
  }
}

type Query {
  hero: Character
}

type Character {
  name: String
  friends: [Character]
  homeWorld: Planet
  species: Species
}

type Planet {
  name: String
  climate: String
}

type Species {
  name: String
  lifespan: Int
  origin: Planet
}
```

Move faster with powerful developer tools
Know exactly what data you can request from your API without leaving your editor, highlight potential issues before sending a query, and take advantage of improved code intelligence.

Evolve your API without versions

Add new fields and types to your GraphQL API without impacting existing queries. Aging fields can be deprecated and hidden from tools. By using a single evolving version, GraphQL APIs give apps continuous access to new features and encourage cleaner, more maintainable server code.

```
type Film {
  title: String
  episode: Int
  releaseDate: String
}

type Film {
  title: String
  episode: Int
  releaseDate: String
  openingCrawl: String
}

type Film {
  title: String
  episode: Int
  releaseDate: String
  openingCrawl: String
  director: String
}

type Film {
  title: String
  episode: Int
  releaseDate: String
  openingCrawl: String
  director: String
  directedBy: Person
}

type Person {
  name: String
  directed: [Film]
  actedIn: [Film]
}

type Film {
  title: String
  episode: Int
  releaseDate: String
  openingCrawl: String
  director: String @deprecated
  directedBy: Person
}
```

Bring your own data and code
GraphQL creates a uniform API across your entire application without being limited by a specific storage engine. Write GraphQL APIs that leverage your existing data and code with GraphQL engines available in many languages. You provide functions for each field in the type system, and GraphQL calls them with optimal concurrency.

```
type Character {
    name: String
    homeWorld: Planet
    friends: [Character]
}

// type Character {
class Character {
    // name: String
    getName() {
        return this._name
    }

    // homeWorld: Planet
    getHomeWorld() {
        return fetchHomeworld(this._homeworldID)
    }

    // friends: [Character]
    getFriends() {
        return this._friendIDs.map(fetchCharacter)
    }
}
# type Character {
class Character:
    # name: String
    def name(self):
        return self._name

    # homeWorld: Planet
    def homeWorld(self):
        return fetchHomeworld(self._homeworldID)

    # friends: [Character]
    def friends(self):
        return map(fetchCharacter, self._friendIDs)


// type Character {
public class Character {
  // name: String
  public String Name { get; }

  // homeWorld: Planet
  public async Task<Planet> GetHomeWorldAsync() {
    return await FetchHomeworldAsync(_HomeworldID);
  }

  // friends: [Character]
  public async IEnumerable<Task<Character>> GetFriendsAsync() {
    return _FriendIDs.Select(FetchCharacterAsync);
  }
}
```

## the useMutation React hook

Then, we return an object with the same properties as the object in the success case

When an error occurs, Apollo Server attaches an extensions field to that error that contains relevant error details.

The resolver handles both a successful response and possible errors. Which of these are true about the return objects for those two cases?

We start with the same assignSpaceship Mutation resolver example as in the previous code challenge. This time, we assume the dataSources.spaceAPI.assignSpaceshipToMission() call will return an error. Modify the following piece of code to properly handle the error returned by the API and return a properly formatted object that conforms to the schema definition of the AssignSpaceshipResponse type. Remember to use a try/catch block and to return dynamic error data when possible.

Now that we have our schema, data source, and resolvers set up with helpful mutation responses

Screenshot of Explorer with an empty Operation panel, ready for us to start building our query
Click the plus button (⊕) beside incrementTrackViews to add it to our Operation panel. This pre-fills some information for us! The syntax should feel familiar because it's the same syntax we've seen so far with our queries, particularly in Lift-off III where we used arguments and variables.

✍️ Building a GraphQL mutation

IncrementTrackViews : the mutation operation

incrementTrackViews : the mutation entry point

```
"Capital M is used for the Mutation type definition in the schema."
mutation IncrementTrackViews($incrementTrackViewsId: ID!) {
  incrementTrackViews(id: $incrementTrackViewsId) {
    code
    success
    message
    track {
      id
      numberOfViews
    }
  }
}
```

We use hooks to send requests to our GraphQL API from a React client. To send a mutation, we use the **useMutation** hook. This returns an **array**, where the first element is the **mutate function** used to trigger the mutation. The second element is an object with more information about the mutation, such as loading, error and **data**. This hook takes in a **GraphQL operation** as the first parameter. It also takes in an **options** object as the second parameter, where properties like **variables** are set.

The useQuery hook returns an array, whereas the useMutation hook returns an array.

The useQuery hook is used to send queries, whereas the useMutation hook is used to send mutation.

The useQuery hook runs automatically on component render, whereas the useMutation hook returns a mutate function needed to trigger the mutation.

```js
const ASSIGN_SPACESHIP_MUTATION = gql`
  mutation AssignSpaceshipToMissionMutation($spaceshipId: ID!, $missionId: ID!) {
    assignSpaceship(spaceshipId: $spaceshipId, missionId: $missionId) {
      code
      success
      message
      spaceship {
        name
      }
      mission {
        codename
      }
    }
  }
`

const spaceshipId = "ROCKET_X"
const missionId = "M0007"

const [assignSpaceship, { loading, error, data }] = useMutation(ASSIGN_SPACESHIP_MUTATION, {
  variables: { spaceshipId, missionId }
})
```

We want to update the number of views just before we navigate from the homepage to the track page. This navigation is happening inside our TrackCard component.

Because this is a mutation and not a query, we won't be using the useQuery hook we're familiar with.

Unlike with useQuery, calling useMutation doesn't actually execute the mutation automatically!

The useMutation hook returns an array with two elements, which we'll start to destructure here.

The first element is the mutate function we'll use to actually run the mutation later on.

When do we want to run our mutate function? When the user clicks on the card!

To do this, let's go back to where we set up our useMutation hook and add another property to our options object.

The onCompleted property is a callback function that will run when the mutation successfully completes, and it has access to the response that comes back. We'll log the response to the browser console.

variables: spaceshipId and missionId. Destructure the mutate function (call it assignSpaceship), as well as the loading, error and data properties from the return array of the hook.

Mutation was completed after the page was loaded
