# End-To-End Type-Safety

[GitHub](https://github.com/sabinadams/e2e-type-safety) by [Sabin Adams](https://twitter.com/sabinthedev) is a great teacher. This page of notes was created when I was following his 4-part tutorials - [End-To-End Type-Safety with GraphQL, Prisma & React](https://www.prisma.io/blog/e2e-type-safety-graphql-react-1-I2GxIfxkSZ) on [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/).

## test

GraphQL Yoga is a batteries-included cross-platform GraphQL over HTTP spec-compliant GraphQL server powered by Envelop and GraphQL Tools that runs anywhere; focused on easy setup, performance and great developer experience.

```bash title="installation"
yarn add graphql graphql-yoga
```

```js title="schema.js"
import { createSchema } from "graphql-yoga"

export const schema = createSchema({
  typeDefs: /* GraphQL */ `
    type Query {
      hello: String
    }
  `,
  resolvers: {
    Query: {
      hello: () => "world"
    }
  }
})
```

```js title="index?.tx"
import { createServer } from "node:http"
import { createYoga } from "graphql-yoga"
import { schema } from "./schema"

// create a Yoga instance with a GraphQL schema
const yoga = createYoga({ schema })

// pass it into a server to hook into request handlers
const server = createServer(yoga)

// start the server and you're done!
server.listen(4000, () => {
  console.info("Server is running on http://localhost:4000/graphql")
})
```

## Part 3

the Pothos Prisma plugin, allowed you to ensure the types across your ORM, GraphQL object types, GraphQL query types, and resolvers were all in sync with the database schema.

Set up the Pothos schema builder

Define a Date scalar type

Defined your GraphQL object and query types

Queried for data using Prisma Client

Add the Pothos Prisma plugin

Create a reusable instance of Prisma Client

Apply the GraphQL schema

focus on ensuring your interactions with the database, data handling within your resolvers, and data responses are all type-safe and that those types are in sync.

Set up a GraphQL server with GraphQL Yoga

```bash title="use GraphQL Yoga as the GraphQL server"
yarn add @graphql-yoga/node graphql
```

```ts title="src/index.ts"
import { createServer } from "@graphql-yoga/node"

const port = Number(process.env.API_PORT) || 4000

const server = createServer({
  port
})

// start up the GraphQL server on port 4000
server.start().then(() => {
  console.log(`üöÄ GraphQL Server ready at http://localhost:${port}/graphql`)
})
```

```bash title="start up the GraphQL server on port 4000"
yarn dev
# or
npx ts-node-dev src/server.ts
```

Set up the schema builder

GraphQL uses a strongly typed schema to define how a user can interact with the API and what data should be returned. There are two different approaches to building a GraphQL schema: code-first and SDL-first.

Code-first: Your application code defines and generates a GraphQL schema

SDL-first: You manually write the GraphQL schema

Choosing the code-first approach with **Pothos**.

Pothos : a popular schema builder

```bash title=""
yarn add @pothos/core
touch src/builder.ts
```

```ts title="src/builder.ts"
import SchemaBuilder from "@pothos/core"

// create an instance of the Pothos schema builder as a sharable module
export const builder = new SchemaBuilder({})
```

Define a Date scalar type

GraphQL supports a limited set of scalar data types : Int, Float, String, Boolean, ID

The DateTime data type used in Prisma Schema is NOT supported.

```bash title=""
# install a pre-made custom scalar type created by the open-source community
yarn add graphql-scalars
```

register a Date scalar with your schema builder to let it know how to handle dates. The schema builder takes in a generic where you can specify various configurations.

register the Data scalar type:

```ts title="src/builder.ts"
import SchemaBuilder from "@pothos/core"
import { DateResolver } from "graphql-scalars"

// create an instance of Pothos' SchemaBuilder as a sharable module
export const builder = new SchemaBuilder<{
  Scalars: {
    // register a scalar type called "Date" using SchemaBuilder's Scalars configuration
    Date: { Input: Date; Output: Date }
  }
}>({})

// let the builder know to handle the defined Date scalar type
builder.addScalarType("Date", DateResolver, {})
```

Your GraphQL object types and resolvers can now use the Date scalar type.

Define your GraphQL object types

Provide type safety between your GraphQL types and the database schema.

```bash title=""
# install the Pothos Prisma plugin
# this plugin provides a Prisma generator that generates the types Pothos requires
yarn add @pothos/plugin-prisma
```

install this API's node modules and regenerate Prisma Client this each time this application is deployed later in the series,

```json title="add a script in package.json"
"scripts": {
  // "build": "npm i && npx prisma generate"
  "build": "yarn && npx prisma generate"
}
```

```bash title="generate Prisma Client with the Pothos integration"
yarn build
```

```text
‚ùØ yarn build
yarn run v1.22.19
$ yarn && npx prisma generate

You can now start using Prisma Client in your code. Reference: https://pris.ly/d/client
```

import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client'
const prisma = new PrismaClient()

```
‚ú®  Done in 2.62s.
```

```ts title="src/builder.ts"
import SchemaBuilder from "@pothos/core"
import { DateResolver } from "graphql-scalars"
import PrismaPlugin from "@pothos/plugin-prisma"
// import the generated Pothos types and apply them to your builder
import type PrismaTypes from "@pothos/plugin-prisma/generated"

// create an instance of Pothos' SchemaBuilder as a sharable module
export const builder = new SchemaBuilder<{
  Scalars: {
    // register a scalar type called "Date" using SchemaBuilder's Scalars configuration
    Date: { Input: Date; Output: Date }
  }
  PrismaTypes: PrismaTypes
}>({
  plugins: [PrismaPlugin]
})

// let the builder know to handle the defined Date scalar type
builder.addScalarType("Date", DateResolver, {})
```

Pothos is smart enough to know that, because you are using the Prisma plugin, you need to provide a prisma instance to the builder. This is used by Pothos to infer information about the types in your Prisma Client.

create and add that instance to the builder.

For now, register the Prisma plugin and the generated types in the builder instance to let Pothos know about them:

Create a reusable instance of Prisma Client and provide it to the builder

instantiate

```ts title="src/db.ts"
import { PrismaClient } from "@prisma/client"
export const prisma = new PrismaClient()
```

```ts title="src/builder.ts"
import SchemaBuilder from "@pothos/core"
import { DateResolver } from "graphql-scalars"
import PrismaPlugin from "@pothos/plugin-prisma"
// import the generated Pothos types and apply them to your builder
import type PrismaTypes from "@pothos/plugin-prisma/generated"
import { prisma } from "./db"

// create an instance of Pothos' SchemaBuilder as a sharable module
export const builder = new SchemaBuilder<{
  Scalars: {
    // register a scalar type called "Date" using SchemaBuilder's Scalars configuration
    Date: { Input: Date; Output: Date }
  }
  PrismaTypes: PrismaTypes
}>({
  plugins: [PrismaPlugin],
  prisma: {
    client: prisma
  }
})

// let the builder know to handle the defined Date scalar type
builder.addScalarType("Date", DateResolver, {})
```

Configured the Pothos Prisma plugin

take the types generated by Prisma and allows you easy access to those within your GraphQL object types and queries.

the single source of truth is the Prisma schema which handles types in your database, the API used to query the database, and the GraphQL schema.

Define the GraphQL object types using the builder configured with the Prisma plugin

> The Prisma schema defines the shape of the data in the database, while the GraphQL schema defines the data available in the API.

Define the User object type and its related queries that you will expose through your GraphQL API

```ts title="src/models/User.ts"
// import the builder instance
import { builder } from "../builder"

// the prismaObject method is used to define your object types
// "User" : The name of the Prisma model that this new type represents
// {} : The config options object for the type being defined
// define a GraphQL type definition and register it in the builder instance
builder.prismaObject("User", {
  fields: (t) => ({
    id: t.exposeID("id"),
    name: t.exposeString("name"),
    messages: t.relation("messages")
  })
})
```

> Ctrl + Space within an empty set of quotes before typing in the name field, you should get some nice auto-completion with a list of available models from your Prisma schema thanks to the Prisma plugin.

> Ctrl + Space when you begin to type in a field name will give you a list of fields in the target model that match the data type of the "expose" function you are using.

Generating a schema from the builder does not actually store a GraphQL schema in your file system that you can check out,

```graphql title="the resulting type definition will look like this"
type User {
  id: ID!
  name: String!
  messages: [Message!]!
}
```

the createdAt field has the DateTime type in your Prisma schema and will need a custom configuration to define the custom date scalar type you defined:

```ts title="src/models/Message.ts"
import { builder } from "../builder"

builder.prismaObject("Message", {
  fields: (t) => ({
    id: t.exposeID("id"),
    body: t.exposeString("body"),
    createdAt: t.expose("createdAt", {
      type: "Date"
    })
  })
})
```

```graphql title="the resulting object type definition will look like this"
type Message {
  id: ID!
  body: String!
  createdAt: Date!
}
```

we have object types defined for your GraphQL schema

have not yet defined a way to actually access that data --> implement your queries --> initialize a Query type

```ts title="src/builder.ts"
import SchemaBuilder from "@pothos/core"
import { DateResolver } from "graphql-scalars"
import PrismaPlugin from "@pothos/plugin-prisma"
// import the generated Pothos types and apply them to your builder
import type PrismaTypes from "@pothos/plugin-prisma/generated"
import { prisma } from "./db"

// create an instance of Pothos' SchemaBuilder as a sharable module
export const builder = new SchemaBuilder<{
  Scalars: {
    // register a scalar type called "Date" using SchemaBuilder's Scalars configuration
    Date: { Input: Date; Output: Date }
  }
  PrismaTypes: PrismaTypes
}>({
  plugins: [PrismaPlugin],
  prisma: {
    client: prisma
  }
})

// let the builder know to handle the defined Date scalar type
builder.addScalarType("Date", DateResolver, {})

// intialize the Query type using builder's queryType function
builder.queryType({})
```

This registers a special GraphQL type that holds the definitions for each of your queries and acts as the entry point to your GraphQL API. You define this type in the builder.ts file to ensure the query builder has a Query type defined, that way you can add query fields to it later on.

Within this queryType function, you have the ability to add query definitions directly, however, you will define these separately within your codebase to better organize your code.

```ts title="src/models/User.ts"
// import the builder instance
import { builder } from "../builder"
// import the prisma instance
import { prisma } from "../db"

// the prismaObject method is used to define your object types
// "User" : The name of the Prisma model that this new type represents
// {} : The config options object for the type being defined
// define a GraphQL type definition and register it in the builder instance
builder.prismaObject("User", {
  fields: (t) => ({
    id: t.exposeID("id"),
    name: t.exposeString("name"),
    messages: t.relation("messages")
  })
})

// add a field to the GraphQL schema's Query type named "users"
// define a "users" query that exposes the User object type you defined
builder.queryField("users", (t) =>
  t.prismaField({
    // let Pothos know this field will resolve to an array of your Prisma Client's User type
    // define a field that resolves to some type in your Prisma schema
    type: ["User"],
    // set up a resolver function for this field
    resolve: async (query, root, args, ctx, info) => {
      return prisma.user.findMany({ ...query })
    }
  })
)
```

> The resolve function's query argument at the beginning of the argument list. This is a specific field Pothos populates when using prismaField function that is used to load data and relations in a performant way. This may be confusing if you come from a GraphQL background as it changes the expected order of arguments.

```graphql title="the resulting Query type will look like this"
type Query {
  users: [User!]!
}
```

Apply the GraphQL schema

Register all of these object types and queries in a single place and generate the GraphQL schema

, causing the code within the files to be run, and run the builder instance's toSchema function to generate the GraphQL schema:

```ts title="src/schema.ts"
import { builder } from "./builder"

// import the models
import "./models/Message"
import "./models/User"

// generate an abstract syntax tree (AST) representation of your GraphQL schema
export const schema = builder.toSchema({})
```

```graphql title="the AST and GraphQL representations would look like this"
scalar Date

type Message {
  body: String!
  createdAt: Date!
  id: ID!
}

type Query {
  users: [User!]!
}

type User {
  id: ID!
  messages: [Message!]!
  name: String!
}
```

```ts title="src/index.ts"
import { createServer } from "@graphql-yoga/node"
import { schema } from "./schema"

const port = Number(process.env.API_PORT) || 4000

const server = createServer({
  port,
  // accept the generated GraphQL schema
  schema
})

server.start().then(() => {
  console.log(`üöÄ GraphQL Server ready at http://localhost:${port}/graphql`)
})
```

The GraphQL schema has been defined using a code-first methodology

The GraphQL object and query types are in sync with the Prisma schema models

The GraphQL server is being provided the generated GraphQL schema.

```bash title="start the server"
npm run dev

# http://localhost:4000/graphql in your browser to access the GraphQL playground
```

set up code generation to keep the types on your frontend client and API in sync. Then you will deploy your finished application!

## Part 1

index.html and Project Root

index.html is front-and-central instead of being tucked away inside public. This is intentional: during development Vite is a server, and index.html is the entry point to your application.

```text
Vite treats index.html as source code and part of the module graph. It resolves <script type="module" src="..."> that references your JavaScript source code. Even inline <script type="module"> and CSS referenced via <link href> also enjoy Vite-specific features. In addition, URLs inside index.html are automatically rebased so there's no need for special %PUBLIC_URL% placeholders.

Similar to static http servers, Vite has the concept of a "root directory" which your files are served from. You will see it referenced as <root> throughout the rest of the docs. Absolute URLs in your source code will be resolved using the project root as base, so you can write code as if you are working with a normal static file server (except way more powerful!). Vite is also capable of handling dependencies that resolve to out-of-root file system locations, which makes it usable even in a monorepo-based setup.
```

Vite also supports multi-page apps with multiple .html entry points.

Specifying Alternative Root
Running vite starts the dev server using the current working directory as root. You can specify an alternative root with vite serve some/sub/dir.

Command Line Interface
In a project where Vite is installed, you can use the vite binary in your npm scripts, or run it directly with npx vite. Here are the default npm scripts in a scaffolded Vite project:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "vite", // start dev server, aliases: `vite dev`, `vite serve`
    "build": "vite build", // build for production
    "preview": "vite preview" // locally preview production build
  }
}
```

You can specify additional CLI options like --port or --https. For a full list of CLI options, run npx vite --help in your project.

End-to-end type safety is implemented by ensuring the types across your entire application's stack are kept in sync.

In order to ensure your application is type-safe, you will need to create a set of TypeScript types that define your two data models: users and messages.

In the next sections of this series, you will replace these manually written types with automatically generated ones that contain up-to-date representations of your API's exposed data model.

## Part 2

implement end-to-end type safety using React, GraphQL, Prisma, and some other helpful tools that tie those three together.

set up all of the pieces needed to build a GraphQL API

a PostgreSQL database, initialize Prisma in your project, and finally seed your database.

source of truth for the shape of your data.

```bash title="setup the backend | part 1"

mkdir src
touch src/index.ts
```

Write a testing script.

```ts title="src/index.ts"
console.log("Hey there! üëã")
```

Add the `scripts` property to package.json

```json title="add to package.json"

```

Deploy a PostgreSQL database using [Railway](https://railway.app)

Login with GitHub --> New Project --> Provision PostgreSQL --> click the PostgreSQL instance --> click the Connect tab --> copy the string of PostgreSQL Connection URL

Our GraphQL server will use Prisma Client to query your PostgreSQL database.

```bash title="setup the backend | part 2"
yarn add -D prisma
npx prisma init
# paste the string of PostgreSQL Connection URL to `.env`
```

Data modeling

Think of **Prisma Schema** as **a glue** between PostgreSQL database and the API that interacts with it. Prisma Schema will be used to generate a **type-safe API** that interacts with PostgreSQL database.

```prisma title="prisma/schema.prisma"
model User {
  id        Int       @id @default(autoincrement())
  name      String
  createdAt DateTime  @default(now())
  messages  Message[]
}

model Message {
  id        Int      @id @default(autoincrement())
  body   String
  createdAt DateTime @default(now())
  userId    Int
  user      User     @relation(fields: [userId], references: [id])
}
```

```bash title="perform the first migration"
# create a new migration file named `init`
# apply that migration to your database
# generate Prisma Client based on Prisma Schema
npx prisma migrate dev --name init
```

```text title="Railway takes one min in handling this task"
Environment variables loaded from .env

The following migration(s) have been created and applied from new schema changes:

migrations/
  ‚îî‚îÄ 20230110013818_init/
    ‚îî‚îÄ migration.sql

Your database is now in sync with your schema.
