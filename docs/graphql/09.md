populate the queried schema fields with mocked data

Floating in the vacuum of localhost space without access to any data, it's a sad and lonely server for now. ðŸ˜¿

If we don't have an error, we must have data!

<Layout grid>{JSON.stringify(data)}</Layout>
```

query for a single track using GraphQL arguments

git clone https://github.com/apollographql/odyssey-lift-off-part3

A module should be a standalone type: a single track might include any number of modules, and one module might be part of multiple tracks. --> Create a separate Module type.

need a refresher

Let's dig deeper into why.

```
const GET_MISSION = gql`
query getMission($isScheduled: Boolean) {
  mission(scheduled: $isScheduled) {
    id
    codename
  }
}
`
```

boilerplate for our Track page.
skeleton of the Track page.

```
const GET_SPACECAT = gql`
  query getSpacecat($spaceCatId: ID!) {
    spacecat(id: $spaceCatId) {
      name
    }
  }
`;

const spaceCatId = 'kitty-1';
```

the navigation from the homepage to the track page.

routing implementation

The first time we send a query to the GraphQL server, Apollo Client stores the results in the cache. The next time we try to send that same query (for example, navigating to the same page again), it will load the results from the cache, instead of sending unnecessary calls across the network. Apollo Client takes care of this caching behavior for us with the InMemoryCache.
