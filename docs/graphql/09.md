populate the queried schema fields with mocked data

Floating in the vacuum of localhost space without access to any data, it's a sad and lonely server for now. ðŸ˜¿

If we don't have an error, we must have data!

```js title="the JSON.stringify() method"
<Layout grid>{JSON.stringify(data)}</Layout>
```

query for a single track using GraphQL arguments

git clone https://github.com/apollographql/odyssey-lift-off-part3

A module should be a standalone type: a single track might include any number of modules, and one module might be part of multiple tracks. --> Create a separate Module type.

#

An argument is a value you provide for a particular field in your query. The schema defines the arguments that each of your fields accepts.

Arguments can help you retrieve specific objects, filter through a set of objects, or even transform the field's returned value. A query that performs a search usually provides the user's search term as an argument.

getTrack(trackId) {
  return this.get(`track/${trackId}`);
}

paceCat field to query a spaceCat by ID. Follow the conventions used above for the four resolver parameters. Use the dataSources object to access the spaceCatsAPI.getSpaceCat() method, which takes the id from args and returns the results.

```
const resolvers = {
  Query: {
        spaceCat: (_, { id }, { dataSources }) => {
      return dataSources.spaceCatsAPI.getSpaceCat(id)
    }


  }
}
```
