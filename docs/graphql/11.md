GraphQL schema defines what types of data a client can read and write to your graph. Schemas are strongly typed, which unlocks powerful developer tooling.

Fetch a list of all upcoming rocket launches
Book a launch for a logged-in user
Cancel a previously booked launch for a logged-in user

above that the missionPatch field of the Mission type takes an argument named size, which is of the enum type PatchSize. When you query for a field that takes an argument, the field's value can vary depending on the provided argument's value. In this case, the value you provide for size will determine which size of the mission's associated patch is returned (the SMALL size or the LARGE size).

### The Mutation type

A mutation's return type is entirely up to you, but we recommend defining special object types specifically for mutation responses.

an array of any Launches that were modified by the mutation

good practice for a mutation to return whatever objects it modifies so the requesting client can update its cache and UI without needing to make a follow-up query.

Introspection is a helpful GraphQL feature that enables you to obtain a server's schema for development purposes. It should be disabled for servers running in production. Apollo Server disables introspection automatically if the NODE_ENV environment variable is set to production.

Your schema's root types (Query and Mutation) appear. You can click any type to view its fields and step down into your schema. You'll see that the types and fields match what we provided to our server.

#

A data source is any database, service, or API that holds the data you use to populate your schema's fields. Your GraphQL API can interact with any combination of data sources.

Apollo provides a DataSource class that we can extend to handle interaction logic for a particular type of data source. extend DataSource to connect both a REST API and a SQL database to Apollo Server.

We use this.launchReducer (which we'll write next) to transform each returned launch into the format expected by our schema. If there are no launches, an empty array is returned.

Now we need to write the launchReducer method, which transforms returned launch data into the shape that our schema expects. This approach decouples the structure of your schema from the structure of the various data sources that populate its fields.

```
type Launch {
  id: ID!
  site: String
  mission: Mission
  rocket: Rocket
  isBooked: Boolean!
}
```

Now, let's write a launchReducer method that transforms launch data from the REST API into this schema-defined shape.

Notice that launchReducer doesn't set a value for the isBooked field in our schema. That's because the Space-X API doesn't know which trips a user has booked! That field will be populated by our other data source, which connects to a SQLite database.

Using a reducer like this enables the getAllLaunches method to remain concise as our definition of a Launch potentially changes and grows over time. It also helps with testing the LaunchAPI class, which we'll cover later.

The SpaceX API is a read-only data source for fetching launch data. We also need a writable data source that allows us to store application data, such as user identities and seat reservations. To accomplish this, we'll connect to a SQLite database and use Sequelize for our ORM.

Because this section contains SQL-specific code that isn't necessary for understanding Apollo data sources

Apollo doesn't provide a canonical DataSource subclass for SQL databases at this time. So, we've created a custom data source for our SQLite database by extending the generic DataSource class.

src/datasources/user.js:

The initialize method: Implement this method if you want to pass any configuration options to your subclass. The UserAPI class uses initialize to access our API's context.

this.context: A graph API's context is an object that's shared across every resolver in a GraphQL request. We'll cover resolvers in detail in the next section. Right now, all you need to know is that the context is useful for storing and sharing user information.

Caching: Although the RESTDataSource class provides a built-in cache, the generic DataSource class does not. If you want to add caching functionality to your data source, you can configure an external backend or build your own.

Let's go over some of the methods in src/datasources/user.js that we use to fetch and update data in our database. You'll want to refer to these in the next section:

findOrCreateUser({ email }): Finds or creates a user with a given email in the database.

bookTrips({ launchIds }): Takes an object with an array of launchIds and books them for the logged-in user.

cancelTrip({ launchId }): Takes an object with a launchId and cancels that launch for the logged-in user.

getLaunchIdsByUser(): Returns all booked trips for the logged-in user.
isBookedOnLaunch({ launchId }): Determines whether the logged-in user has booked a trip on a particular launch.

Pass a dataSources option to the ApolloServer constructor. This option is a function that returns an object containing newly instantiated data sources.

If you use this.context in a datasource, it's critical to create a new instance of that datasource in the dataSources function, rather than sharing a single instance. Otherwise, initialize might be called during the execution of asynchronous code for a particular user, replacing this.context with the context of another user.

A resolver function returns one of the following:

the data and A promise that fulfills with data of the required type

The resolver function signature

Argument Description

parent This is the return value of the resolver for this field's parent (the resolver for a parent field always executes before the resolvers for that field's children).

args This object contains all GraphQL arguments provided for this field.

context This object is shared across all resolvers that execute for a particular operation. Use this to share per-operation state, such as authentication information and access to data sources.

info This contains information about the execution state of the operation (used only in advanced cases).

instances of our LaunchAPI and UserAPI data sources

Define top-level resolvers

the resolver for a parent field always executes before the resolvers for that field's children.

All three resolver functions assign their first positional argument (parent) to the variable \_ as a convention to indicate that they don't use its value.

The launches and me functions assign their second positional argument (args) to \_\_ for the same reason.

(The launch function does use the args argument, however, because our schema's launch field takes an id argument.)

```graphql title="a test query"
query GetLaunches {
  launches {
    launches {
      id
      mission {
        name
      }
    }
  }
}
```

```graphql title="a test query that takes an argument"
query GetLaunchById {
  launch(id: "60") {
    id
    rocket {
      id
      type
    }
  }
}
```

same query using a variable instead of 60:

```graphql title="same query with a variable for passing argument"
query GetLaunchById($id: ID!) {
  launch(id: $id) {
    id
    rocket {
      id
      type
    }
  }
}
```

```
QUERY_VARIABLES
{
  "id": "60"
}
```

Apollo Server defines a default resolver for any field you don't define a custom resolver for.

A default resolver function uses the following logic:

default resolver logic

For most (but not all) fields of our schema, a default resolver does exactly what we want it to. Let's define a custom resolver for a schema field that needs one, Mission.missionPatch.

This field has the following definition:

```
type Mission {
  # Other field definitions...
  missionPatch(size: PatchSize): String
}
```

The resolver for Mission.missionPatch should return a different value depending on whether a query specifies LARGE or SMALL for the size argument.

This resolver obtains a large or small patch from mission, which is the object returned by the default resolver for the parent field in our schema, Launch.mission.

Now that we know how to add resolvers for types besides Query, let's add some resolvers for fields of the Launch and User types

You might be wondering how our server knows the identity of the current user when calling functions like getLaunchIdsByUser.

Paginate results
Currently, Query.launches returns a long list of Launch objects. This is often more information than a client needs at once, and fetching that much data can be slow. We can improve this field's performance by implementing pagination.

Pagination ensures that our server sends data in small chunks. We recommend cursor-based pagination for numbered pages, because it eliminates the possibility of skipping an item or displaying the same item more than once. In cursor-based pagination, a constant pointer (or cursor) is used to keep track of where to start in the data set when fetching the next set of results.

cursor-based pagination

server/src/schema.js

```js
type Query {
  launches( # replace the current launches query with this one.
    """
    The number of results to show. Must be >= 1. Default = 20
    """
    pageSize: Int
    """
    If you add a cursor here, it will only return results _after_ this cursor
    """
    after: String
  ): LaunchConnection!
  launch(id: ID!): Launch
  me: User
}

"""
Simple wrapper around our list of launches that contains a cursor to the
last item in the list. Pass this cursor to the launches query to fetch results
after these.
"""
type LaunchConnection { # add this below the Query type as an additional type.
  cursor: String!
  hasMore: Boolean!
  launches: [Launch]!
}
```

Query.launches takes in two parameters (pageSize and after) and returns a LaunchConnection object. The LaunchConnection includes:

A list of launches (the actual data requested by a query)
A cursor that indicates the current position in the data set
A hasMore boolean that indicates whether the data set contains any more items beyond those included in launches

Open src/utils.js and check out the paginateResults function. This is a helper function for paginating data from the server.

Now, let's update the necessary resolver functions to accommodate pagination. Import paginateResults and replace the launches resolver function in src/resolvers.js with the code below:

Let's test the cursor-based pagination we just implemented. Restart your server with npm start and run this query in Apollo Sandbox:

```graphql
query GetLaunches {
  launches(pageSize: 3) {
    launches {
      id
      mission {
        name
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Thanks to our pagination implementation, the server should only return three launches instead of the full list.

That takes care of the resolvers for our schema's queries! Next, let's write resolvers for our schema's mutations.
