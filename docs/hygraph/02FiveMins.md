# Headless CMS explained

A Headless CMS is a **backend-only** content management system, making content accessible via an API for display on any platform and device, **without a built-in front-end or presentation layer**.

Traditional CMSs, such as WordPress, keep teams highly dependent on a vendor's preferred frameworks, databases, templates, devices - whilst only being able to render on one frontend, i.e. a single website or a single mobile app. In the long term, once overheads like training, maintenance, and security updates are accounted for ...

"Head"

- Front end (websites, apps, TVs, watches, dishwashers, fridges)

- Thanks to the spreading diversity of platforms that need content.

"Body" : Back end (content repository, database)

Detaching / separating / decoupling the front end from the back end --> Headless

Headless CMSs do not dictate where or how content is shown.

- Content is not restricted to a specific front end.

- Marketing / editorial teams create content. Text, images, videos, files, etc are stored as structured content within the CMS.

- Engineering team define how and where the content is delivered.

- Content can be published in greater efficiency.

- Content delivery becomes more flexible via APIs rather than web page rendering. This approach leads to a more scalable architecture.

- Provides better ROI since they are cloud-based, security and backups are handled by the vendor.

## Benefits of Headless CMS

1. Front end freedom

Bring content to any platform (native apps, VR, IoT, etc). Hygraph allows you to develop with any technology for any platform making your product scalable when your users need you to be.

2. Well structured data

Working with clearly defined data allows for your development team to know where to pick up, instantly. Hygraph content infrastructure clearly defines the operations (queries, and mutations) supported by the API.

3. Future-proof content

A headless CMS allows for your content to be modified immediately and as-needed by your content creators. Minimize the impact of redesigns, product changes, and migrations with a decoupled content solution.

4. Security and Scalability

With one point of connection, your headless CMS allows for only one access point of vulnerability. Hygraph offers many robust features for protecting your endpoint including permanent auth tokens, DDOS mitigation strategies, and more.

5. Team flexibility

You want to hire the most talented developers possible. No need to teach a prehistoric web template language just to manage your content. Work with any modern language stack your team pleases.

6. Consolidated content repository

It's counterintuitive to copy, paste & recreate content for your app across different platforms! Consolidating all of your content within one API minimizes your overhead cost, time, and development resources.

Why use a Headless CMS and do you need one?

Traditional CMS has the benefit of comfort - since we're all familiar with them. A CMS like WordPress is often a default solution when you want a simple website, don't have technical resources to create a custom experience, and are ok with working on templates that resemble generic websites.

However, for organizations that depend on delivering cross-platform experiences across multiple channels, especially on a global scale, a Headless CMS grows in importance. Since you have complete control over how and where content is delivered, a Headless CMS is usually a preferred option for forward-thinking teams, especially in fast-paced industries.

Because a Headless CMS doesn't restrict you to a specific technology (PHP and MySQL in the case of WordPress), you and your team are free to build projects with preferred options like having a CMS for React, Angular, Vue, and so on.

If you don't want to be restricted to a specific tech stack, don't want to be constricted to pre-defined templates and themes, and need added functionality that lets you push content to multiple platforms, then investing in a Headless CMS would be worth looking into.

What is API-First Content Management?

What is Managed Content as a Service (MCaaS)?

Content as a Service is essentially the evolution of how content is managed, stored, and delivered. It is a service-oriented model where the "Service Provider" delivers the content on-demand to the "Service Consumer" via licensed cloud-based subscription services.

With the traditional CMS, the content had the option of being stored physically on a local, dedicated, or shared server, as well as in the cloud. Furthermore, security upgrades and database backups would be the responsibility of the entities to maintain their CMS. With the emergence of global distribution, Content Delivery Networks (CDN), and caching, cloud-based solutions are preferred for security, reliability, and speed.

A Headless CMS fundamentally offers content "as a service", allowing content to be created and stored within the CMS, and then channeled to any platform via APIs. Since it isn't dictating the content to be "for human consumption" directly, it allows a way to provide raw content to other systems that further refine the content to be rendered on the end platform. This way, your content is always hosted in a centralized "content repository" on the cloud - allowing you to create, manage, and edit your content whenever you wish, and accordingly distribute it to any systems and channels as and when required.

What is API-First Content Management?

Simply put, an API-First CMS is a Headless CMS. The concept it's built upon is the maintenance of content within a content repository where APIs (like REST and GraphQL) distribute the content to multiple front ends based on how they request what content.

An API-First CMS allows brands and companies to reach out to consumers on any device, which is especially important with the emergence of IoT and smart products - that have drastically transformed the way in which consumers interact and engage with brands. Traditional CMS like WordPress would make it near impossible to natively power voice assistants when used as a CMS for Alexa or Google Home since traditional platforms are not built to deliver experiences to these kinds of devices.

A Headless CMS, however, is.

In the case of voice assistants, brands can just create content using a CMS for voice and deliver structured data as answers to voice commands, responses to questions, or as snippets for feeds.

On a higher and more pragmatic level, this also gives organizations the freedom to dictate their MarTech stack and define their own digital experiences. Legacy CMS would have teams fall prey to a vendor lock-in since the CMS would dictate the authoring experience, the visualization of the content, and the interdependence of its own plugin ecosystem, whereas a Headless CMS gives brands the flexibility to freely integrate their preferred tools, software, and analytics to create their own digital experience platforms.

## Frequently Asked Questions

What is a Headless CMS?

A headless CMS is a content management system that provides a way to create, edit, and deliver content to one or several frontends. Instead of having your content tightly coupled to a particular frontend (like a website or mobile app), it provides your content as data over an API to be served to any frontend.

What is a Headless Website?

A headless website is one built using a Headless CMS, where the content is served via API from a content backend, rather than from a classical “Web CMS”. The same content can be distributed to multiple websites, apps, and other digital platforms when needed.

How do you use a Headless CMS?

To use a headless CMS, you have to build a website or an application first, then use the CMS's API to query and serve your content into it. This is in contrast to “creating your content on the website” as in the case of page builders and classic Web CMS.

Should I use a Headless CMS?

If you are creating a simple corporate website or portfolio, perhaps not. If you have development resources and are building multiple or complex websites, applications, and other digital products, then it may be worth exploring Headless CMS. The same applies to whether you require stronger flexibility and performance with your digital projects.

What does Headless mean?

Headless means that the application is running without a graphical user interface (GUI) and sometimes without a user interface at all. The frontend (head) is detached from the backend (body), allowing both to be developed independently.

What are some other terms for Headless CMS?

Headless CMS may commonly be referred to as Content Database, Content Backend, Content Repository, or Content API. It is essentially a backend-only content management system that acts as a content repository, and makes content accessible via an API for display on any device, without controlling the presentation layer(s).
