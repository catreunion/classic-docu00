# Apollo Odyssey GraphQL Tutorials

## Catstronauts

### Apollo Server and Apollo Explorer

Catstronauts : A learning platform for adventurous cats (developers) who want to explore the universe (GraphQL)! ðŸ˜º ðŸš€

### Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/apollographql/odyssey-lift-off-part1
cd server
yarn

yarn add apollo-server graphql
# graphql : provides the core logic for parsing and validating GraphQL queries
# apollo-server : provides a full-fledged, spec-compliant GraphQL server with some nice utilities like the gql template literal

yarn start
```

Open a new terminal.

```bash
cd client
yarn
yarn start
# go to http://localhost:3000/
```

### Defining the schema

At its heart, a schema is a collection of **object types** that contain **fields**. Each field has a type of its own.

1. What data do we need to build our app?

2. Title, Thumbnail image, Length (estimated duration), Module count, Author name, Author picture

3. A collection of **objects** and **relationships between objects**.

4. Think of each object as a **node** and each relationship as an **edge** between two nodes.

5. Define this **graph structure** using a schema.

Schema Definition Language (SDL)

We declare a type using the **type** keyword, followed by the name of the type (**PascalCase** is best practice), then **opening brackets** to hold its contained fields.

**Fields** are declared by their name (**camelCase**), a **colon**, and then the type of the field (scalar or object). A field can contain a list, indicated by **square brackets**.

Fields are not separated by commas.

If a field should never be null, we add an exclamation mark after its type.

```js
const typeDefs = gql`
  """
  details of
  a space cat
  """
  type SpaceCat {
    name: String!
    age: Int
    "a space cat should have a list of missions"
    missions: [Mission]
  }
`
```

`gql`

- Called a tagged template literal

- Wrap GraphQL strings

- backticks (`) is used with the gql tag

A schema is like a contract between the server and the client. It defines what a GraphQL API can and can't do, and how clients can request or change data.

Writing strings (in **double quotes**) directly above types or fields as **descriptions**

### The Track type

A track is a group of Modules. Each of which about a specific topic.

```js title='server/src/schema.js'
const { gql } = require("apollo-server")

// typeDefs <-- a constant, short for "type definitions"
const typeDefs = gql`
  "A track is a group of modules teaching one specific topic"
  type Track {
    id: ID!
    title: String!
    author: Author!
    thumbnail: String
    length: Int
    modulesCount: Int
  }
`

module.exports = typeDefs
```

### The Author type

An author might create multiple tracks.

```graphql
type Author {
  id: ID!
  name: String!
  photo: String
}
```

### The Query type

Telling the GraphQL server what to retrieve when we query it.

```
type Track {
  id: ID!
  title: String!
  author: Author!
  "will be shown in cards & details"
  thumbnail: String
  "approximate length to complete, in minutes"
  length: Int
  "number of modules this track contains"
  modulesCount: Int
}

type Author {
  id: ID!
  "author's first and last name"
  name: String!
  "url of author's profile picture"
  photo: String
}

type Query {
  "return a non-null list of non-null Tracks"
  tracksForHome: [Track!]!
}
```

# write your schema definitions here

```js
const typeDefs = gql`
  type Track {
    id: ID!
    title: String!
    author: Author!
    "will be shown in cards & details"
    thumbnail: String
    "approximate length to complete, in minutes"
    length: Int
    "number of modules this track contains"
    modulesCount: Int
  }

  type Author {
    id: ID!
    "author's first and last name"
    name: String!
    "url of author's profile picture"
    photo: String
  }

  type Query {
    "return a non-null list of non-null Tracks"
    tracksForHome: [Track!]!
    spaceCats: [SpaceCat]
  }

  type SpaceCat {
    id: ID!
    name: String!
    age: Int
    missions: [Mission]
  }

  type Mission {
    id: ID!
    name: String!
    description: String!
  }
`
```

### Wording

In the directory of your choice with your preferred terminal, clone the app's starter repository:
