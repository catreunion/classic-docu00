# Mutations

Queries and mutations are two types of GraphQL **operations**. Queries are **read** operations that always **retrieve** data. Mutations are **write** operations that always **modify** data.

Much like Query type, Mutation type serves as an **entry point** to our **schema** / GraphQL API.

## Comparing Spacecats object type and Missions object type

A spacecat has a list of missions they've been assigned to.

A mission can also have more than one spacecat assigned to it, like a crew.

- Assign one spacecat to a particular mission

- Update that spacecat's list of missions

- Update a mission list of crew members

## Schema syntax of mutations

Mutation names should start with a verb, such as add, delete or create, followed by whatever data you're modifying.

Mutations typically modify a specific object, they often require arguments.

Common fields of mutation response :

1. code : Int - Similar to HTTP status code, represents the status of the mutation

2. success : Boolean

3. message : String

Return type of AssignMissionResponse

Can contain partial errors and partial successful data.

When a mutation modifies multiple objects, it can return all the objects of return type.

```
type IncrementTrackViewsResponse {
  code: Int!
  success: Boolean!
  "Human-readable message for the UI"
  message: String!
  "Newly updated track after a successful mutation"
  track: Track
}

"increment this number every time a user visits the track page from the homepage"
type Mutation {
  incrementTrackViews(id: ID!): IncrementTrackViewsResponse!
}
```

```
type Spaceship {
  id: ID!
  year: Int!
  missionCount: Int
}

type Mission {
  id: ID!
  codename: String!
  spaceship: Spaceship
}

type AssignSpaceshipResponse {
  code: Int!
  success: Boolean!
  message: String!
  spaceship: Spaceship
  mission: Mission
}

"assign a spaceship to a specific mission"
type Mutation {
  assignSpaceship(spaceshipId: ID!, missionId: ID!): AssignSpaceshipResponse!
}
```

## Mutation resolvers

We've set up our data source to make a PATCH call to our REST API. Now it's time to write resolvers to put our data source to work.

In the server/src folder, let's open up the resolvers.js file. We need to add another entry to our resolvers object for our mutation.

We can add it just below our Query resolvers, and we need to give it the same name as in our schema, which is Mutation (note the capital M!).

```
const resolvers = {
  Query: {
    // â€¦ query resolvers
  },
  Mutation: {
    // where our new resolver function will go
  }
};
```

Inside this Mutation object, we'll add the resolver function for our mutation, which also needs to have the same name as in our schema incrementTrackViews. And of course, let's add a helpful comment at the top.

```
// increments a track's numberOfViews property
incrementTrackViews: (parent, args, context, info) => {},
```

Which of these are true about the structure of the resolvers object?

We won't need the parent argument in this resolver, because it's for a root field in our schema. By convention, we'll just add an underscore. We do need to destructure the second parameter args to retrieve the id of the track we're updating. As usual, we'll also destructure the third parameter context for the dataSources object. And finally, we have no need for the fourth parameter info.

Here's what our resolver signature looks like now:

```
<!-- server/src/resolvers.js -->
incrementTrackViews: (_, {id}, {dataSources}) => {
  // where we'll call the TrackAPI
},
```

In the body of the resolver, we want to call the method we added to our TrackAPI. As we saw in Lift-off II, we get access to that TrackAPI through the dataSources object by configuring it in the Apollo Server options.

So inside the incrementTrackViews resolver body, we'll call dataSources.trackAPI.incrementTrackViews, passing it the id from args.

dataSources.trackAPI.incrementTrackViews(id);
So far, we've always immediately returned the results of our TrackAPI calls, because the results match the structure required by our schema.

However, in this case, we have three fields required by our schema that are not present in the returned response: code, success and message. This makes sense because they are tied to the REST operation status itself, so we need to set those three based on that status.

Why can't this resolver immediately return the results of the TrackAPI call in this case?

ðŸ“„ Fulfilling the schema requirements
First, let's wait for the TrackAPI call to finish returning the data. We can do this by making the function async, then storing the results in a variable called track, making sure to await the results.

```
incrementTrackViews: async (_, {id}, {dataSources}) => {
  const track = await dataSources.trackAPI.incrementTrackViews(id);
},
```

Next, let's return an object with all the properties needed to fulfill our schema. For now, we'll assume that the API call was successful, and worry about the error handling in the next lesson.

return {
code: 200,
success: true,
message: `Successfully incremented number of views for track ${id}`,
track
};
So here the code will return 200, the success property will be set to true, and we can return message to show that the number of views was successfully incremented for this specific track ID. And finally, we can return the modified object, track.

In the end, the resolvers object should have a new entry that looks like this:

```
Mutation: {
  // increments a track's numberOfViews property
  incrementTrackViews: async (_, { id }, { dataSources }) => {
    const track = await dataSources.trackAPI.incrementTrackViews(id);
    return {
      code: 200,
      success: true,
      message: `Successfully incremented number of views for track ${id}`,
      track,
    };
  },
},
```

Code Challenge!

Add a resolver for the new assignSpaceship mutation provided in the schema. Use the dataSources.spaceAPI class and its method assignSpaceshipToMission, which takes the spaceshipId and the missionId as arguments (in that order). This method returns an object with the newly updated spaceship and mission. Follow the schema requirements to return an object for the successful result. code should be 200, success should be true and message should say Successfully assigned spaceship ${spaceshipId} to mission ${missionId}
12345678910111213141516171819
// schema for reference

```
const typeDefs = gql`
  type Mutation {
    assignSpaceship(spaceshipId: ID!, missionId: ID!): AssignSpaceshipResponse
  }

  type AssignSpaceshipResponse {
    code: Int!
    success: Boolean!
```

All right, we've got our successful case resolved, but what happens when our TrackAPI throws an error? Let's take care of this in the next lesson.
