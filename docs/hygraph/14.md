# Mutations

Queries and mutations are two types of GraphQL **operations**. Queries are **read** operations that always **retrieve** data. Mutations are **write** operations that always **modify** data.

Much like Query type, Mutation type serves as an **entry point** to our **schema** / GraphQL API.

## Comparing Spacecats object type and Missions object type

A spacecat has a list of missions they've been assigned to.

A mission can also have more than one spacecat assigned to it, like a crew.

- Assign one spacecat to a particular mission

- Update that spacecat's list of missions

- Update a mission list of crew members

Return type of AssignMissionResponse

Can contain partial errors and partial successful data.

When a mutation modifies multiple objects, it can return all the objects of return type.

## Mutation resolvers

We can add it just below our Query resolvers, and we need to give it the same name as in our schema, which is Mutation (note the capital M!).

add the resolver function for our mutation

call the method we added to our TrackAPI
TrackAPI through the dataSources object by configuring it in the Apollo Server options.

So inside the incrementTrackViews resolver body, we'll call dataSources.trackAPI.incrementTrackViews, passing it the id from args.

üìÑ Fulfilling the schema requirements

let's return an object with all the properties needed to fulfill our schema. For now, we'll assume that the API call was successful, and worry about the error handling in the next lesson.

assignSpaceship

spaceship, mission

All right, we've got our successful case resolved, but what happens when our TrackAPI throws an error? Let's take care of this in the next lesson.

## the useMutation React hook

Then, we return an object with the same properties as the object in the success case

When an error occurs, Apollo Server attaches an extensions field to that error that contains relevant error details.

The resolver handles both a successful response and possible errors. Which of these are true about the return objects for those two cases?

We start with the same assignSpaceship Mutation resolver example as in the previous code challenge. This time, we assume the dataSources.spaceAPI.assignSpaceshipToMission() call will return an error. Modify the following piece of code to properly handle the error returned by the API and return a properly formatted object that conforms to the schema definition of the AssignSpaceshipResponse type. Remember to use a try/catch block and to return dynamic error data when possible.

Now that we have our schema, data source, and resolvers set up with helpful mutation responses

Click the plus button (‚äï) beside incrementTrackViews to add it to our Operation panel. This pre-fills some information for us! The syntax should feel familiar because it's the same syntax we've seen so far with our queries, particularly in Lift-off III where we used arguments and variables.

‚úçÔ∏è Building a GraphQL mutation

IncrementTrackViews : the mutation operation

incrementTrackViews : the mutation entry point

```
"Capital M is used for the Mutation type definition in the schema."
mutation IncrementTrackViews($incrementTrackViewsId: ID!) {
  incrementTrackViews(id: $incrementTrackViewsId) {
    code
    success
    message
    track {
      id
      numberOfViews
    }
  }
}
```

We use hooks to send requests to our GraphQL API from a React client. To send a mutation, we use the **useMutation** hook. This returns an **array**, where the first element is the **mutate function** used to trigger the mutation. The second element is an object with more information about the mutation, such as loading, error and **data**. This hook takes in a **GraphQL operation** as the first parameter. It also takes in an **options** object as the second parameter, where properties like **variables** are set.

The useQuery hook returns an array, whereas the useMutation hook returns an array.

The useQuery hook is used to send queries, whereas the useMutation hook is used to send mutation.

The useQuery hook runs automatically on component render, whereas the useMutation hook returns a mutate function needed to trigger the mutation.

```js
const ASSIGN_SPACESHIP_MUTATION = gql`
  mutation AssignSpaceshipToMissionMutation($spaceshipId: ID!, $missionId: ID!) {
    assignSpaceship(spaceshipId: $spaceshipId, missionId: $missionId) {
      code
      success
      message
      spaceship {
        name
      }
      mission {
        codename
      }
    }
  }
`

const spaceshipId = "ROCKET_X"
const missionId = "M0007"

const [assignSpaceship, { loading, error, data }] = useMutation(ASSIGN_SPACESHIP_MUTATION, {
  variables: { spaceshipId, missionId }
})
```

We want to update the number of views just before we navigate from the homepage to the track page. This navigation is happening inside our TrackCard component.

Because this is a mutation and not a query, we won't be using the useQuery hook we're familiar with.

Unlike with useQuery, calling useMutation doesn't actually execute the mutation automatically!

The useMutation hook returns an array with two elements, which we'll start to destructure here.

The first element is the mutate function we'll use to actually run the mutation later on.

When do we want to run our mutate function? When the user clicks on the card!

To do this, let's go back to where we set up our useMutation hook and add another property to our options object.

The onCompleted property is a callback function that will run when the mutation successfully completes, and it has access to the response that comes back. We'll log the response to the browser console.

variables: spaceshipId and missionId. Destructure the mutate function (call it assignSpaceship), as well as the loading, error and data properties from the return array of the hook.

Mutation was completed after the page was loaded
