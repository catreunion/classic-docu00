# Mutations

Queries and mutations are two types of GraphQL **operations**. Queries are **read** operations that always **retrieve** data. Mutations are **write** operations that always **modify** data.

Much like Query type, Mutation type serves as an **entry point** to our **schema** / GraphQL API.

## Comparing Spacecats object type and Missions object type

A spacecat has a list of missions they've been assigned to.

A mission can also have more than one spacecat assigned to it, like a crew.

- Assign one spacecat to a particular mission

- Update that spacecat's list of missions

- Update a mission list of crew members

Return type of AssignMissionResponse

Can contain partial errors and partial successful data.

When a mutation modifies multiple objects, it can return all the objects of return type.

## Mutation resolvers

We can add it just below our Query resolvers, and we need to give it the same name as in our schema, which is Mutation (note the capital M!).

add the resolver function for our mutation

call the method we added to our TrackAPI
TrackAPI through the dataSources object by configuring it in the Apollo Server options.

So inside the incrementTrackViews resolver body, we'll call dataSources.trackAPI.incrementTrackViews, passing it the id from args.

ðŸ“„ Fulfilling the schema requirements

let's return an object with all the properties needed to fulfill our schema. For now, we'll assume that the API call was successful, and worry about the error handling in the next lesson.

assignSpaceship

spaceship, mission

All right, we've got our successful case resolved, but what happens when our TrackAPI throws an error? Let's take care of this in the next lesson.
