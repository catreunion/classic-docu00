# Apollo Federation : A modular architecture

Apollo Federation is an architecture for creating modular graphs. Your graph is built in smaller pieces that all work together.

[FlyBy](https://odyssey-flyby.netlify.app) : Let's imagine we've been transported far into the future, where everyone can traverse the galaxy for fun and adventure. FlyBy's users can browse a list of all the locations fellow space travelers have visited.

## One or more **subgraphs**

The graph's functionality is divided across smaller, modular graphs called **subgraphs**. --> Schema is split across **multiple schema files**.

Each subgraph is a **standalone GraphQL server** with its own schema file, data sources and resolvers. A subgraph schema should contain the types and fields it is responsible for resolving / populating.

How do we connect the fields of a single object when they're resolved by multiple subgraphs? (Lessons 9-14)

In a production environment, each server will be running on it's own repository.

```bash title="Repos from apollographql.com"
git clone https://github.com/apollographql/odyssey-voyage-I

# each server runs on a different port --> can be run at the same time in local environment
# 4000 : router
# 4001 : subgraph-locations
# 4002 : subgraph-reviews

# navigate to subgraph-locations
yarn add @apollo/subgraph

# navigate to subgraph-reviews
yarn add @apollo/subgraph
```

## The router (single endpoint)

The router splits incoming GraphQL operations into **smaller operations**, with the help of **supergraph schema**. Each split operation is resolved by a single underlying subgraph.

Supergraph schema is composed of all the fields and types from each subgraph schema. Like a map, it helps the router determine which subgraph can resolve a field in an operation.

A very helpful illustration by [apollographql.com](https://www.apollographql.com/tutorials/voyage-part1/intro-to-federation)

![The journey of a GraphQL operation in a supergraph with the router and subgraphs](https://res.cloudinary.com/apollographql/image/upload/e_sharpen:50,c_scale,q_90,w_1440,fl_progressive/odyssey/federation-course1/F_01_01_IL_04_simple_architecture_exy5jk.png)

## The federation workflow

### Step 1 : Collaborate with the frontend team to agree on the app's data requirements and implement a schema-first design.

Decide how to split up these data needs across multiple subgraphs. <-- Schema agreement

### Step 2 : Backend developers independently design and build their subgraphs.

After agreeing on multiple subgraphs, frontend and backend teams can work in parallel. Backend developers :

1. Decide how to distribute types and fields across multiple subgraphs.

2. Work on their own subgraphs independently <-- **Separation of concerns principle** : Clear boundaries of responsibility for different parts of the graph.

3. Have the flexibility to choose the language, infrastructure, and policies that work best for each subgraph. For example, subgraphs can have different numbers of instances, security protocols or caching stragtegies.

4. Build out their own subgraph servers, complete with schemas, data sources and resolvers.

### Step 3 : Someone **creates a new supergraph** in Apollo Studio.

### Step 4 : Backend developers **publish** their **subgraph schemas** to Apollo schema registry with Rover.

```bash
# install Rover
curl -sSL https://rover.apollo.dev/nix/latest | sh

# /Users/isaac/.rover/bin will be automatically added to the PATH environment variable next time you log in
# https://go.apollo.dev/r/docs
# exec /bin/zsh -l
# you can set APOLLO_TELEMETRY_DISABLED=1

# authenticate with APOLLO_KEY
rover config auth
```

### Step 5 : The schema registry attempts to **combine** all the schemas from registered subgraphs into **a single supergraph schema**. <-- **Composition**

If succeeds and no validation errors, the schema registry sends the supergraph schema to **Apollo Uplink** (an internal service).

Uplink is a server that stores the latest supergraph schema for each project.

The schema registry is a version control system. **Schemas changes can be tracked**.

### Step 6 : The **router** polls Uplink for the latest supergraph schema.

The router polls Uplink periodically for any new versions of the supergraph schema.

The router resolve incoming GraphQL operations. Clients will be able to reference and query from the latest supergraph schema.

## The journey of a GraphQL operation through the Apollo supergraph federation

Trace the journey of a client request through the supergraph

Describe how the router creates query plans to resolve GraphQL operations across multiple subgraphs

The journey of a GraphQL operation through the supergraph
Let's start at the beginning: from the client request.

### Step 1 : A client sends a GraphQL operation to the router.

The client has no clue which fields belong to which subgraphs, or even that there are subgraphs at all.

### Step 2 : The router builds a query plan.

A list of smaller GraphQL operations to execute on subgraphs.

Also **specify the order** in which subgraph operations need to run.

The router looks at the fields in the operation and uses the **supergraph schema** to figure out which subgraphs are responsible for resolving each field.

### Step 3 : The router executes the query plan.

Send the smaller GraphQL operations to the appropriate subgraphs.

Subgraphs resolve the operations. <-- Retrieve and populate the requested data.

### Step 4 : The router combines all the returned responses into a single JSON object.

### Step 5 : The router sends the final JSON object to the client.

## `locations.graphql`

A schema that defines the types and fields owned by the `locations` subgraph.

Contain a selection of the most recently submitted reviews.

```graphql title="locations.graphql"
extend schema @link(url: "https://specs.apollo.dev/federation/v2.0", import: ["@key"])

type Location @key(fields: "id") {
  id: ID!
  name: String!
  description: String!
  photo: String!
}

type Query {
  locations: [Location!]!
  location(id: ID!): Location
}
```

  }
}
```

## `reviews.graphql`

`overallRating` and `reviewsForLocation` have **more to do with reviews** than they do with `locations`, even though they seem to be fields on the Location object type.

```graphql title="reviews.graphql"
extend schema @link(url: "https://specs.apollo.dev/federation/v2.0", import: ["@key"])

type Review {
  id: ID!

## `buildSubgraphSchema`

**@apollo/subgraph** contains a function called **buildSubgraphSchema**

- Accept an object containing **typeDefs** and **resolvers**

- Return a federation-ready **subgraph schema**

## wording

For a smoother learning experience

```graphql title="to test subgraph-locations server"
query GetAllLocations {
  locations {

  }
}
```

```graphql title="to test subgraph-reviews server"
query GetLatestReviews {
  latestReviews {
    id
    comment
    rating
  }
}
```

The buildSubgraphSchema function takes an object containing typeDefs and resolvers and returns a federation-ready subgraph schema. This schema includes a number of federation directives and types that enable our subgraph to take full advantage of the power of federation. More on that in a bit!

save two environment variables from Apollo Studio

APOLLO_KEY : An API key for authenticating Rover. It starts with something like service:your-graph-name.

APOLLO_GRAPH_REF : The graph reference (or graph ref) for our supergraph, which we'll use to tell
Rover where to publish our subgraphs.

A graph ref starts with the graph's ID, followed by an @ symbol, followed by the graph variant.

"rover subgraph publish" part of the command

register our subgraphs to the schema registry, and Apollo Studio automatically composed our supergraph schema for us!

Click on the SDL tab at the top of the Schema page. Here we can see details about our published subgraphs, along with two additional schemas.

API schema

- The GraphQL API that gets exposed to your clients

- Cleanly and logically represents the combination of your subgraph schemas.

Supergraph schema

- Used by the router like a map, to define how incoming GraphQL operations can be divided up among the underlying subgraphs

- Provide a complete picture for the router to query for information about locations, reviews, or any combination of the two

- Studio will automatically recompose this supergraph schema anytime we push a change to either one of our subgraphs.

- Consolidate all the types and fields across our published subgraphs. It also includes extra directives to help the router determine which subgraphs can resolve each field.

how the supergraph schema identifies the types and fields that belong to each one of our subgraphs.

the fields we added to the Query type in both subgraphs have been consolidated in one place. Each field is annotated with a special @join_field directive that references the name of its originating subgraph.

```graphql title="Supergraph schema"
type Query @join__type(graph: LOCATIONS) @join__type(graph: REVIEWS) {
  locations: [Location!]! @join__field(graph: LOCATIONS)
  location(id: ID!): Location @join__field(graph: LOCATIONS)

  """
  The three latest reviews submitted for FlyBy's locations
  """
  latestReviews: [Review!]! @join__field(graph: REVIEWS)
}
```

how the router uses the supergraph schema to resolve incoming GraphQL operations and bundle data from multiple subgraphs into one clean response.

# Set up the Apollo Router locally

So far, FlyBy's subgraphs are running and their schemas have been published, but we still need one piece to tie everything together: the router.

Connect our router to Apollo Studio
Send our first query to our supergraph
✏️ Downloading the router
The Apollo Router is a high-performance graph router built in Rust. It's available as an executable binary that you can add to your project in a few steps:

```bash
# navigate to the router directory in the FlyBy project
❯ cd router

# download & install the router
❯ curl -sSL https://router.apollo.dev/download/nix/latest | sh

Downloading router from https://github.com/apollographql/router/releases/download/v1.7.0/router-v1.7.0-x86_64-apple-darwin.tar.gz ...

Up next
Congratulations, we now have a working supergraph! Our frontend team can get back all the data they need from a single GraphQL operation, and we've improved our development experience by modularizing the backend!

But there's still one problem we need to solve.

Remember those three fields we still haven't added to our schema? You remember! Here's that schema agreement again, to jog your memory:

The FlyBy schema diagram, updated to check off the fields we've added to the reviews and locations subgraphs so far
Even though our router can query each subgraph separately, we can't associate data between the two subgraphs yet.

Well, next up we'll learn about the feature that will make coordination between our subgraphs possible: entities.

# entities!

Revisiting our schema agreement checklist, we still have three fields that we don't know how to implement yet:

Location.reviewsForLocation and Location.overallRating: These are both fields of the Location type, but we decided we want them to be owned by the reviews subgraph.

Review.location: This is a field on the Review type (which lives in the reviews subgraph), but the field has a return type of Location, which is defined in the locations subgraph.

Learn what an entity is and what it's used for
Learn how to define an entity
Learn how the router represents entities when it talks between subgraphs

What's an entity?

An entity is an object type with fields split between multiple subgraphs. <-- Both of our subgraphs can contribute fields to and resolve independently.

![2 subgraphs contributing fieleds to an entity]()

In FlyBy, we want our reviews to include the location that they are written about.

Our Location type needs to be used by both subgraphs, so we'll be turning the Location type into an entity.

A subgraph that defines an entity can do one or both of the following:

1. Reference the entity

2. Contribute fields to the entity

### Reference the entity

Referencing an entity means using it as a return type for another field defined in the subgraph.

in the reviews subgraph, we can add a location field to the Review type, which will reference the Location entity as its return type.

The Review type, with a location field that has a return value of a Location type

### Contribute fields to the entity

Contributing fields to an entity means that one subgraph adds new fields to an entity that are specific to that subgraph's concerns.

the Location entity will have fields for name, description, and photo, which will live in the locations subgraph. In other words, the locations subgraph contributes these fields to the Location entity.

the reviews subgraph contributes two review-specific fields to the Location entity: reviewsForLocation and overallRating.

The Location entity, with fields divided between the locations and reviews subgraph

### How to create an entity

To convert an object into an entity in the subgraph schema, we need to do two things:

1. Define a primary key

2. Define a reference resolver

Defining a primary key

An entity's primary key is the field (or fields) that can uniquely identify an instance of that entity within a subgraph. The router uses primary keys to collect data from across multiple subgraphs and associate it with a single entity instance.

a location entity's primary key is its id. The router uses that id to collect data about a specific location instance, like a location with id "loc-1".

Illustration showing three entities with unique ids

In each of our subgraph schemas, we can define a primary key for an entity, by adding the @key directive after the type's name.

The @key directive needs a property called fields, which we'll set to the field we want to use as the entity's primary key.

Entity syntax

```graphql title=""
type EntityType @key(fields: "id")
```

Illustration showing the syntax for defining an entity. See code snippet above for an example.

Defining a reference resolver function

Each subgraph that contributes fields to an entity also needs to define a special resolver function for that entity called a reference resolver. The router uses reference resolvers to directly access the entity fields that each subgraph contributes.

Illustration of each subgraph contributing fields to an entity with an associated reference resolver.

Every reference resolver has the name: \_\_resolveReference. We define each entity's reference resolver right alongside all the field resolvers for that type.

The **resolveReference function has a slightly different signature from other resolver functions. Instead of the usual four arguments, **resolveReference only takes three:

`reference`: The entity representation object that's passed in by the router. This tells the subgraph which instance of an entity is being requested. We'll cover what an entity representation is in the section below.

`context`: The object shared across all resolvers. This is the same as in normal resolvers.

`info`: Contains information about the operation's execution state, just like in a normal resolver.
We won't use this argument much.

Illustration of each subgraph contributing fields to an entity with an associated reference resolver.

Let's focus on this first argument, reference, and learn more about entity representations.

What's an entity representation?

An entity representation is an object that the router uses to represent a specific instance of an entity. A representation always includes the typename for that entity and the @key field for the specific instance.

The **typename field: This field exists on all GraphQL types automatically. It always returns the name of its containing type, as a string. For example, Location.**typename returns "Location".
The @key field: The key-value pair that a subgraph can use to identify the instance of an entity. For example, if we defined the Location entity using the "id" field as a primary key, then our entity representation would include an "id" property with a value like "loc-2".
An entity representation for a location might look like this:

Example location entity representation

```graphql title=""
{
  "__typename": "Location",
  "id": "loc-2"
}
```

think of an entity representation as a passport that the router uses to refer to a particular object between subgraphs.

The typename field is like a passport's country of origin. It says which entity the object belongs to. And the @key field is like a passport's ID number, uniquely identifying this instance of that entity.

The representation object is like a passport

Where should an entity's \_\_resolveReference function be defined?

An entity is a type that can resolve its fields across multiple subgraphs.

To create an entity, we can use the @key directive to specify which field(s) can uniquely identify an object of that type.

We can use entities in two ways:

As a return type for a field (referencing an entity).

Defining fields for an entity from multiple subgraphs (contributing to an entity).

Any subgraph that contributes fields to an entity needs to define a reference resolver function for that entity. This \_\_resolveReference resolver is called whenever the router needs to access fields of the entity from within another subgraph.

An entity representation is an object that the router uses to represent a specific instance of an entity. It includes the entity's type and its key field(s).
