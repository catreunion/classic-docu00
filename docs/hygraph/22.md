# From monolithic to federated

Common problems that developers experience with a monolithic GraphQL schema

Developers experience a lot of friction when trying to grow and evolve their graph when the monolithic schema becomes too big to handle

Lack of focus on domain responsibilities caused by the presence of unrelated types and fields

Difficulty navigating to the information they need in a constantly growing schema file

Merge conflicts caused by modifying the same schema file as multiple other individuals and teams

Airlock, a space travel app to book a trip to new, exciting, sometimes-fictional places in the vast universe?

find listings that meet your dates of choice and the number of beds you'll need. Learn what each place is all about and what amenities it offers, and if you're interested, you can book your stay in one click (provided you have enough space credits in your wallet of course)!

If you're looking to rent out your own space suite, you can do that with Airlock too! Add your listing to the platform with all the necessary details and start managing your bookings. After each stay, guests and hosts will leave honest ratings and reviews about each other.

## Airlock's evolution story

Soon enough, the small unassuming app transformed into an unwieldy monolith. The developer experience is degrading as friction starts to creep in - schema changes and improvements are met with merge conflicts, inconsistencies and duplicated information. It's becoming difficult to navigate the large schema file! New features and bug fixes are taking longer to deploy.

it more closely resembles a big monolith monster with many different business domains represented as types, queries, and mutations all contained in a single humongous .graphql file!

üë©üèΩ‚ÄçüöÄ The Accounts Team says:

"We're in charge of all things related to users, accounts, and user profiles! We think it's a fairly small scope to work within, so it's been a pain having to sift through all the other business domains in the schema that don't involve our intended changes."

üë©üèΩ‚Äçüè´ The Listings Team says:

"We deal with all the cool space rentals in Airlock: their information, amenities, and linking them back to a profile (which the Accounts team is responsible for). We definitely own a big chunk of what's in the schema right now and we make a lot of changes with new features and improvements! Oftentimes, we have merge conflicts with other teams."

all of the schema's types, fields, and behavior will still be preserved and working as usual.

First and foremost, we want to make sure that throughout this process, the web app client doesn't experience any issues and that queries continue to work as normal!

Here are the high-level steps for our migration plan:

1. convert the monolith GraphQL server into a subgraph server, which we'll run on a different port.

2. create a router running on the monolith's original port. The router will be connected to the schema registry and will handle all of the same queries that were previously being sent to the monolith server.

3. slit off small chunks of our single monolith subgraph into new domain-specific subgraphs. This will take several steps, which we'll explain in more detail later on.

the Strangler Fig approach - a migration technique that involves incrementally replacing an old system with new components until the old system is "strangled" and can be completely removed.

A simple schema can potentially evolve into a big, intimidating schema that is difficult to navigate and work with for different teams

Avoid any issues with the client by following a migration plan that swaps the original monolith server with the router.

#

Learn how the backend GraphQL server is organized
Learn what services and data sources the server uses
Have both the server and client running on our local machine
Set up the graph on Apollo Studio
Set up the Rover CLI

```bash
git clone https://github.com/apollographql/odyssey-voyage-II-server

# navigate to monolith/
cd odyssey-voyage-II-server/monolith/

# install
yarn
```

For simplicity's sake, all locally-run services are located in the same repo. In a real-world scenario, each of these is more likely to be located in a different repo and owned and maintained by a different team.

4000 monolith server
4011 Accounts REST API
4010 Listings REST API
Local Bookings SQLite database
Local Reviews SQLite database
Hosted Payments REST AP

```bash title="monolith/"
# start up all the services hosted locally
# npm run launch
yarn launch
```

We'll see a bunch of output come up in the terminal. Each message is prefixed with a color-coded label identifying which service or server the message belongs to. The accounts, listings, bookings, and reviews services should now be running!

We won't be modifying anything in the services directory!

Data sources

Our GraphQL server uses data sources to connect and communicate with each service

AccountsAPI: a RESTDataSource that connects to the accounts service
ListingsAPI: a RESTDataSource that connects to the listings service
BookingsDb: a custom DataSource class that connects to the bookings service using Sequelize
ReviewsDb: a custom DataSource class that connects to the reviews service using Sequelize
PaymentsAPI: a RESTDataSource that connects to the payments service

Running the GraphQL server

Apollo Server is initialized in monolith/index.js.

Our server uses two pieces that are important to our graph:

the schema (located in schema.graphql)
the resolvers (located in resolvers.js)

```bash title="monolith/"
# start up the monolith server
# npm start
yarn start
```

nodemon : any changes we save to our code will also automatically restart the server

Retrieve all the amenities that a listing can provide. From the sidebar on the left, we can choose the listingAmenities field. Then for each amenity, we want to retrieve its category and name. Finally, let's rename the query to GetAllAmenities so it describes what it does.

```graphql title="http://localhost:4000"
query GetAllAmenities {
  listingAmenities {
    category
    name
  }
}
```

Feel free to play around with other queries, but note that not all of them may work! Some fields are protected and can only be accessed with the correct authorization permissions. We'll take a look at how to set those later on in the course.

## Publishing the graph to Studio

create a new graph by clicking the + New Graph button in the upper right corner of the dashboard.

expand the section below to find your specific steps on how to create a graph.

Change the Graph Architecture to Monolith

studio.apollographql.com

APOLLO_KEY and APOLLO_GRAPH_REF

studio.apollographql.com

```bash title="monolith/"
üìÇ monolith
‚î£ üìÇ datasources
‚î£ üìÇ node_modules
‚î£ üìÇ utils
‚î£ üìÑ .env
‚î£ üìÑ index.js
‚î£ üìÑ package.json
‚î£ üìÑ resolvers.js
‚îó üìÑ schema.graphql
```

environment variables should never be committed to version control.

.gitignore file which specifies that the .env file should be ignored when committing code changes to a repository.

Click the **Local Schema** button in the modal.

`monolith/schema.graphql`
copy the entire schema
paste into the text area

The Publish your schema modal, showing the Local Schema text area where we can copy and paste our monolith schema

Click **Upload** to submit your schema. When the page refreshes, we should see an overview of all of our types on the Schema Reference page. To test things out, head over to Explorer and run the previous query again!

Explorer will prompt you for the URL of your production server! We'll set the Endpoint value to http://localhost:4000.

```graphql
query GetAllAmenities {
  listingAmenities {
    category
    name
  }
}
```

## Setting up the Rover CLI

Rover is Apollo's official command line interface, and plays a central role in every supergraph.

re-authenticate Rover with the correct APOLLO_KEY

In a terminal in the root of the project, run the following command:

```bash
rover config auth
```

In a new terminal window, outside of the server repo we set up previously, clone the frontend client repo.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/apollographql/odyssey-voyage-II-client
cd odyssey-voyage-II-client
yarn
yarn start
```

You can use Airlock as either a guest or a host by clicking Log In on the top right and selecting the appropriate option. We also have additional account login options for you to choose from, but generally we'll stick with the main Guest or Host buttons.

To switch to a different account after logging in, click the profile picture on the top right of the page and "Log out".
