# Deploy your site

Docusaurus is a **static-site-generator** (also called **[Jamstack](https://jamstack.org/)**).

It builds your site into a directory of static contents : **static HTML, JavaScript and CSS files**

HTML files are statically generated for every possible path

[Deployment Guide](https://docusaurus.io/docs/deployment)

```bash
# build your site for production
# The static files are generated in the `build` folder
npm run build
# yarn build

# test the production build locally
npm run serve

# the `build` folder is served at localhost:3000

# deploy your site
```
